# TablePlus Chrome Extension

Transform and paste tables (and other markup) from your clipboard especially
into Jira.

## Functions

- __Paste Jira Table Markup__ - When the clipboard contains a tab-delimited
  table, it will tranform it into a Jira-markup version (delimited with
  pipes), and paste it.
- __Paste Jira Tranposed Table Markup__ - Tranforms a similar tab-delimited
  table into a transposed (rows to cols conversion) Jira-markup version and
  pastes it.
- __Paste Jira Escaped Markup__ - Escapes with a backslash any Jira
  markup characters contained in the clipboard text and pastes the result.
